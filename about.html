        <p class="content">Greetings! My name is Will, as you can see above! I am 24 years old, and I am from the United States. Delaware Specifically. I originally went to school for Computer Aided Drafting & Design, and somehow along that road, found my way into Sales. After spending about the last 5 years working in Sales, I am quite tired of the process, and looking for something remote, and still something that makes me think. I find that Software Development checks a lot of boxes for me. I can be a introvert when I want, and extrovert when I need to be.</p>
        <p class="content">In my freetime, I love to skydive. I recently got into about 2 years ago, and it has been a life-changing event for me. The feeling of freedom and adrenaline is unmatched. Plus, the community of other people who skydive is a place I like to call my second home. When I am not "fun-jumping" for my own enjoyment, I like to video-tape other people skydiving, and I like to do aerial photography. (Why not right?) I plan to continue to skydive and learn new ways to fly (yes you can fly!) and get into wingsuiting this year. Here are some additional photos for enjoyment! If you are interested in learning how to skydive, you can visit this link <a class="uspa" href="https://www.uspa.org/">HERE</a></p>
